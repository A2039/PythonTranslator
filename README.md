# Language Translator with Text-to-Speech

A **Python-based GUI application** for language translation and text-to-speech functionality, developed using `Tkinter`. This app allows users to input text, translate it into a chosen language, and hear the translated text using a text-to-speech feature.

## Features

- **Text Translation**: Supports translation between multiple languages including English, Hindi, Spanish, German, and French.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the translated text into speech, played directly within the application.
- **Responsive GUI**: Fullscreen application with equal-sized input and output text boxes.
- **Scrollbars**: Input and output boxes are equipped with scrollbars for handling large text inputs and outputs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-translator.git
   cd language-translator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame pillow googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 gtts
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python Translator.py
   ```

- **Tkinter**: Built-in GUI toolkit for Python.
